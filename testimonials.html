                            <h3>My own personal testimony</h3>
                            <p>
                                In my late teens – early 20s, I am 51 now, I was being slowly paralyzed down my entire left side due to a spinal condition I was born with and a subsequent fluid cyst of spinal fluid, syrinx, that had formed along my cervical spine. I had a very risky surgery at 23 that fixed the paralysis issue but left some residual damage along the spine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only notable symptom I had for a long time was some minor balance issues, no riding a bike or skiing for me.

                                About 11 years ago that injured part of my spine developed Osteo-Arthritis and the added inflammation from the arthritis started causing pain in a number of locations, arms, hands, legs, ankles as well migraines. The chronic pain got so bad that in the past 2 years I have been going to the pain clinic every 3 months for spinal injections and prescribed a variety of pain medication. Usually by the time my 6 week follow up at the pain clinic comes up I am already more than ready for my next injection but have to suffer through the next 6 weeks before it can be done.

                                2 months ago I was introduce to iGalen and Emulin, I am taking less pain medication now than I have in 10 years. I am due for my next treatment at the pain clinic and I am not taking any pain medication during the day at all and haven’t had a migraine in 6 weeks.

                                I've had bursitis in both knees for about 3 years. I have prescription cream that has worked to ease the inflammation and pain somewhat but it never completely goes away. If I have to kneel on one or both knees it's agonizing.
I was also taking 400 mg of ibuprofen a day for my knee and a couple of arthritis issues but was told by my dr. to stop and take acetaminophen instead due to stomach issues. Acetaminophen doesn't work and also has undesirable side effects so here I was with no good solution for this. Then about a month ago my sister Heather Popp Law gave me a bottle of Emulin M. Up to a few days ago I hadn't really noticed any significant difference in how I felt until I had to climb under a desk at work this week.
I had to to fix a computer issue and had to do the dreaded crawl under the desk (this is going to hurt like hell). Low and behold, as I put my knees on that floor, I felt no knife stabbing pain for the first time in 3 years. I can't wait to see what else this is going to do.
